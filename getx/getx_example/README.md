# Getx Statemanagement App

### Explanation and Documentation

1. **Main Application (`MyApp`)**:
   - Initializes `GetMaterialApp` which manages navigation and state using GetX.
   - Defines initial route and `GetPage` configurations for routing.

2. **Controller (`ProductController`)**:
   - Manages product-related state and logic.
   - Uses `obs` to make the product list observable.

3. **Model (`Product`)**:
   - Represents a product with `id`, `name`, and `price` properties.

4. **Products Page (`ProductsPage`)**:
   - Displays a list of products fetched from `ProductController`.
   - Navigates to `ProductDetailsPage` using `Get.toNamed` with product ID as arguments.

5. **Product Details Page (`ProductDetailsPage`)**:
   - Retrieves product details based on the provided product ID.
   - Uses `Get.find` to access `ProductController` and fetch the product details.

6. **Binding (`ProductDetailsBinding`)**:
   - Lazily loads `ProductController` specifically for `ProductDetailsPage`.

7. **Middleware (`MyMiddleware`)**:
   - Intercepts route transitions to perform actions before handling the route.
   - Example includes redirection based on authentication status.
